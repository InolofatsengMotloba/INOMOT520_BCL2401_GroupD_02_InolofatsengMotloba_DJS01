### DJS01: Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge

The Mars Climate Orbiter incident in 1999 is a stark reminder of the importance of precision in space missions, highlighting how a simple unit mismatch led to the loss of the spacecraft. This challenge seeks to simulate similar challenges in a spacecraft navigation system, emphasising the need for accuracy in calculations.

#### Challenge Overview

This challenge invites students to debug, refactor, and enhance JavaScript functions designed for determining the trajectory of a spacecraft. The initial functions are flawed and may result in incorrect calculations.

##### Problem Areas Addressed

1. **Unit Mismatch**: The provided functions converts units correctly, leading to calculation accuracies.
2. **Parameter Misalignment**: Parameters are handled in a way that prevents or highlights the potential for unit mismatch errors.

##### Initial Parameters

- **Initial Velocity (`vel`)**: The starting speed of the spacecraft, 10,000 km/h.
- **Acceleration (`acc`)**: The spacecraft's acceleration, 3 m/sÂ².
- **Time (`time`)**: The duration of the calculation, 3,600 seconds (equivalent to 1 hour).
- **Initial Distance (`d`)**: The starting distance from the reference point, 0 km.
- **Initial Fuel (`fuel`)**: The starting amount of fuel, 5,000 kg.
- **Fuel Burn Rate (`fbr`)**: The rate at which fuel is consumed, 0.5 kg/s.

##### Corrected Results

- **New Velocity**: 48880 km/h after correction.
- **New Distance**: 10000 km after correction.
- **Remaining Fuel**: 3,200 kg after correction.
